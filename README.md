# SAN TSG - 2025 Summer Internship Program Development Project

This project was developed as part of the **SAN TSG 2025 Summer Internship Program**. It is a web-based B2C (Business-to-Consumer) e-commerce application that enables the sale of hotel products, built by the internship team.

## Project Purpose

To provide an end-to-end hotel booking experience, allowing users to search for hotels, view details, compare rooms, and make reservations.

The frontend is supported by the [Backend Repo](https://github.com/phantosys/BackendSan) built during the SAN TSG 2025 Summer Internship Program.
